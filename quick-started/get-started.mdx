Our SDK helps you understand **how users interact with your app**, track screens, live events, sessions, session durations, app states, and more with almost zero setup.

Whether you're building an Android app, our SDK seamlessly integrates with your workflow, delivering powerful results with minimal overhead.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

We offer **two SDK options** tailored to different needs:

<table class="getStartedTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SDK Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Analytics SDK</strong></td>
      <td>Tracks screens, user behavior, fragments, tabs, app in background/foreground, and sends notifications and more.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Ad Analytics SDK</strong></td>
      <td>Track live ad events, including requests, impressions, failures, revenue, and more, all in real time. Our SDK also supports individual user-level ad tracking, helping you identify and reduce ad failures for specific users and ensure better performance across your app.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


> Both SDKs share a common foundation, initialize once and start tracking.
