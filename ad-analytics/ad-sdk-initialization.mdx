title: "Ad SDK Initialization"
description: "Set up the Ad SDK by adding the dependency and initializing it in your Application class to start capturing ad-related insights."
---


1. **Add the Ad SDK Dependency**

Add the following dependency to your app-level `build.gradle` file

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Kotlin
implementation("io.github.twinnettechnologies:twinnet-analytics:1.0.1");
```

```javascript Java
implementation "io.github.twinnettechnologies:twinnet-analytics:1.0.1"
```

</CodeGroup>

> üìù **Note**: <br/>
If you're using the **Ad Analytics SDK**, you **do not need to add the Analytics SDK dependency separately**.  The Ad SDK already includes all analytics features and events, and insights.
However, you **must initialize the SDK** in your `Application` class.

2. **Initializing Analytics SDK in Android**

Initialize the **SDK** in your `Application` class to start tracking sessions, events, and insights.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Kotlin
Analytics.Companion.initialize(
    application = this,
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY",
    orgId = "YOUR_ORG_ID"
)
```

```javascript Java
Analytics.Companion.initialize(
    application = this,
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY",
    orgId = "YOUR_ORG_ID"
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameter Reference">

<table class="event-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`application`</td>
      <td>Android application context</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`apiKey`</td>
      <td>Your Project API key</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`orgId`</td>
      <td>Your organization ID (e.g. `twinnet_demo`)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 
</Accordion>

>‚úÖ Best Practice <br/>
Always call `initialize()` inside your `Application` class not inside. an Activity to ensure complete session tracking.


<CodeGroup>

```javascript Kotlin
class MyApp: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Analytics.initialize(
            this,
            "YOUR_API_KEY",
            "YOUR_ORG_ID"
        )
    }
}
```

```javascript Java
class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Analytics.Companion.initialize(
            this,
            "YOUR_API_KEY",
            "YOUR_ORG_ID‚Äù
        )
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>
